### A Guide to helping reporters get up to speed on coronavirus in Japan, with links to authoritative sources

Patrick McKenzie lives in Japan, and has shared _lots_ of information on how the Conoravirus has affected Japan. 

You may say: 
> Cool. I don't know Patrick McKenzie, and I consider myself up to speed on how the corona virus has affected Japan.


Using mostly his words, I'll make a case for why this is likely something you should pay attention to, across several dimensions.

Patrick _usually_ [tweets his thoughts](https://twitter.com/patio11/) but because most of what he tweets requires some prior knowledge/context to fully appreciate, I'll do a quick "intro to Coronavirus in Japan as told by Patrick McKenzie."

This will be necessarily a bit wandering, because at times it seems that Patrick starts a thread without finishing it, only to pick it up a few weeks later, in which his conclusion makes perfect sense _if you've got the context from when he started the thread weeks prior_. 

Explicitly, this document started today, 2020-04-27 2:40p Mountain Time because of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1254856324950528001?s=20)

---------------------------------

### Broadly, sections that should exist in this document:

- Timeline of things happening in Japan (currently working off https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/04/21/japan-coronavirus/#a-brief-timeline-of-the-last-30-days)
- Patrick's specific interventions in circulating [this whitepaper](https://rentry.co/covid19-japan-mr)
- Why patrick's [write-up and "pre-registered result"](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/04/21/japan-coronavirus/) of the above white paper is so important




### Reasons one might generalize specifics from Japan to the wider world:

### Contributions

I started this doc because of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1254856324950528001), in which Patrick said:

> Hey Internets, crazy idea for you:
> 
> I have tweeted, in the last month, much more about coronavirus in Japan than most English-language reporters know, most of it with links to authoritative sourcing.
> 
> Can you crowdsource an organized document of that, to help folks get to speed?

I'm starting this as a _possible_ starting point for that collaboration, but I have no expectation that this be the "finished product". I write a lot of software, and when someone says "organized document" and "crowdsourced" I thinkg github.

I could see this immediately becomeing a mess of PRs with merge conflicts if many folks get involved, so I'd rather work on this in close collaboration with at max two or three others, who will have merge access to the doc, and don't need me to deal with PRs. If interested, could you send me an email? my email address is easy to find.
