### A Guide to helping reporters get up to speed on coronavirus in Japan, with links to authoritative sources

Patrick McKenzie lives in Japan, and has shared _lots_ of information on how the Conoravirus has affected Japan. 

You may say: 
> Cool. I don't know Patrick McKenzie, and I consider myself up to speed on how the corona virus has affected Japan.


Using mostly his words, I'll make a case for why this is likely something you should pay attention to, across several dimensions.

Patrick _usually_ [tweets his thoughts](https://twitter.com/patio11/) but because most of what he tweets requires some prior knowledge/context to fully appreciate, I'll do a quick "intro to Coronavirus in Japan as told by Patrick McKenzie."

This will be necessarily a bit wandering, because at times it seems that Patrick starts a thread without finishing it, only to pick it up a few weeks later, in which his conclusion makes perfect sense _if you've got the context from when he started the thread weeks prior_. 

> Why are _you_ qualified to do this, Josh?

1. Most of what Patrick has tweeted has caused me to nod, and think _he said that so well, and poignantly, dancing a line of "saying things without saying things"_
2. Reporters who have not been reading him for the last few years will need to get up to speed in less than "a few years", I hope that this document might help.

Explicitly, this document started today, 2020-04-27 2:40p Mountain Time because of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1254856324950528001?s=20)

### Broadly, sections that should exist in this document:

- Timeline of things happening in Japan (currently working off, quoting, and summarazing https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/04/21/japan-coronavirus/#a-brief-timeline-of-the-last-30-days)
- Patrick's specific interventions in circulating [this whitepaper](https://rentry.co/covid19-japan-mr)
- Why patrick's [write-up and "pre-registered result"](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/04/21/japan-coronavirus/) of the above white paper is so important
- current/recent happenings, as they tie in to events in Japan of March/April

### Timeline

From [An update on a pre-registered result about the coronavirus](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/04/21/japan-coronavirus/#a-brief-timeline-of-the-last-30-days)

A brief timeline of the last ~30 days

Here is a brief recap of an extremely fluid situation, for the convenience of readers who have not kept up with it. The March 22nd and March 25th entries are not widely known.

**Thursday March 19th**: The NHK panel of experts outlines the national consensus on the coronavirus situation, what the plan is, and what the risk factors to the plan are. Archived [in Japanese](media.kalzumeus.com/covid-19/nhk-panel-of-experts-03192020.pdf) and [in English](media.kalzumeus.com/covid-19/nhk-panel-of-experts-03192020-english.pdf). (This is an unofficial translation commissioned from an unaffiliated commercial translation agency.)

**Saturday March 21st**: Governor Yoshimura (of Osaka) distributes, on live television, an official assessment of the situation in Osaka and Hyogo.

Few note that this happened or understand the significance of the assessment until later in the week.

**Sunday March 22nd**: I tweet [a hash](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1241551327743770624) at 11:24 AM, discussed below. (not widely known) (_this is a hash of [the memo](http://media.kalzumeus.com/covid-19/japan-covid19-memo-202003221115.md) that led to the white paper, discussed below._)

**Monday March 23rd**: Governor Koike (of Tokyo) gives a press conference, at which she claims that it may be necessary to impose a lockdown on Tokyo if there is a rapid rise in infections. She immediately clarifies that this must be avoided at all costs.

**Tuesday March 24th**: A sporting event is postponed.

**Wednesday March 25th**: I tweet [a hash](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1242670345737256962) at 1:31 PM, discussed below. (not widely known)
_[dropping a hash](https://www.kalzumeus.com/essays/dropping-hashes/) explanation, summary is: proves that certain knowledge was known at a certain time, before such knowledge perhaps becomes more widely known_ The hash is the white paper discussed below.

Later in the day, Governor Koike (of Tokyo) urges the populace to start taking voluntary social distancing measures beginning on Saturday.

**Thursday March 26th**: The New York Times publishes [Japan’s virus success has puzzled the world. Has its luck run out?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/asia/japan-coronavirus.html).

A short time later, economist Tyler Cowen at George Mason University published [The coronavirus situation in Japan is probably much worse than you think](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/the-coronavirus-situation-in-japan-is-probably-much-worse-than-you-think.html), covering claims made by a “working group.” Those claims are discussed in more detail below.

In other news: the government’s panel of experts formally assesses that coronavirus is likely “rampant” throughout Japan.

**Friday March 27th**: NHK, Japan’s national broadcaster, does a segment on why “a powerful American newspaper” has such questions about Japan’s well-contained coronavirus issue. Many reporters domestically begin to ask hard questions.

**Saturday March 28th**: The Prime Minister addresses the nation, explains there is no present need to declare a state of emergency, but explains that Japan is in “a state of national hardship (国難) such that it has not experienced since the war.”

**Sunday March 29th through Sunday April 5th**: There are increasingly urgent calls from prefectural governments, the Japanese Medical Association, researchers, and others to declare a state of emergency.

**Monday April 6th**: The Prime Minister announces a state of emergency will be declared in seven prefectures, including Osaka and Tokyo.

**Tuesday April 7th**: The New York Times publishes [Japan declared a coronavirus emergency](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-emergency.html). Is it too late?

**Thursday April 9th**: Aichi requests that the government broaden the scope of the state of emergency to include Aichi.

**Thursday April 16th**: Japan broadens the state of emergency to include the entire nation, and designates 13 prefectures as being of particular concern, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi. There are published reports in Tokyo of hospitals turning away suspected coronavirus patients.

**Friday April 17th**: The Prime Minister addresses the nation, imploring it to reduce human-to-human contact by 70~80%.

**Monday April 20th**: Increasingly specific and repeated calls to strengthen social distancing measures are beginning to show some objective improvement, though the situation is incredibly complex and in different phases throughout the nation. The number of infections continues to increase rapidly.

There are increasing reports of difficulties in accessing medical care.

The number of acknowledged coronavirus cases exceeds 11,000. The number of acknowledged cases requiring the highest level of care is approximately 230.

The National Policy Agency has reclassified several suspicious deaths, including a man who passed away on a city street in Tokyo, as having been caused by coronavirus.

**Tuesday April 21st**: There are increasingly common [warnings](https://medical.jiji.com/topics/1619) by experts that, given the degree of spread of the infection, it is implausible that it will be rolled back within a year. We will likely see new outbreaks and new waves.

Experts warn we will likely need to institute far stricter measures than seemed reasonable a month ago, to avoid a collapse of the medical system. The situation was much worse than we thought.

## "The Working Group" and the white paper

On March 26th at 11:13 PM JST, economist Tyler Cowen [published an essay on Marginal Revolution titled](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/the-coronavirus-situation-in-japan-is-probably-much-worse-than-you-think.html) “The situation in Japan is probably much worse than you think.” The essay recounts of his correspondence, over the prior several days, with an anonymous “working group”, operating in Tokyo.

The Working Group (proper noun hereafter) concluded that Japan had a geographically distributed coronavirus epidemic and predicted a public health crisis in April. The Working Group had been quietly circulating its evidence with appropriate parties in policy circles. As there had been pronouncements by experts officially which were equivalent to their research’s core result, that Japan factually had a coronavirus epidemic, the Working Group published the white paper anonymously to allow the public to prepare.

I instigated the Working Group and I was the primary author of its white paper.

Dr. Cowen linked to a copy of the white paper. We had published it anonymously via a third-party website moments before. Our choice to be anonymous was a considered one and is discussed in more detail below.

Reception of the white paper was mixed. Some people viewed it with understandable concern, given the prevailing consensus that Japan was weathering the situation well. Some organizations were moved by its claims and took high-quality actions in response to it. Some people questioned the motives of the authors and suggested it was extremely unlikely to be correct, because credible science doesn’t get done by amateurs and then anonymously pastebinned.

We had circulated an earlier version of the white paper privately to several parties to check results, obtain feedback, and inform their own investigations. Dr. Cowen was one of those parties.

I started this doc because of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1254856324950528001), in which Patrick said:

> Hey Internets, crazy idea for you:
> 
> I have tweeted, in the last month, much more about coronavirus in Japan than most English-language reporters know, most of it with links to authoritative sourcing.
> 
> Can you crowdsource an organized document of that, to help folks get to speed?

I'm starting this as a _possible_ starting point for that collaboration, but I have no expectation that this be the "finished product". I write a lot of software, and when someone says "organized document" and "crowdsourced" I think "Github!".

I could see this immediately becomeing a mess of PRs with merge conflicts if many folks get involved, so I'd rather work on this in close collaboration with at max two or three others, who will have merge access to the doc, and don't need me to deal with PRs. If you're interested, could you send me an email? my email address is easy to find. I'll make you a collaborator on the repo. Or Google doc.
